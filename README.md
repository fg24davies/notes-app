Rio's Pieces of Eight (Notes app)   
----

- First Javascript group project completed during week 7 of the Makers bootcamp (3 full days). The project is written in vanilla javascript with no external libraries/frameworks
- We wrote our own testing framework that runs like Jasmine in the browser
- Team members: [@louballantyne](https://github.com/louballantyne), [@loushark](https://github.com/loushark), [@dmgreaves](https://github.com/dmgreaves) and myself


How to setup the code
----

- Clone this repo
- To run the app in the browser open `UI/index.html` 
- To see the testing framework open `specRunnerNotebook.html` and  `specRunnerNotes.html` in the browser


Functionality
----
- The app has the functionality for the following user stories:


```
As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
So I can find the one I want
```

```
As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember
```

```
As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
So I can see all the information in the note
```

```
As a programmer
I can use shortcodes like `:fire:` that get converted into emojis like ðŸ”¥
So I can record notes with fun little pictures
```

```
As a programmer
I can refresh the page and still see my notes
So I can remember what I took down
```

Reflection
----
- To add styling with more time
